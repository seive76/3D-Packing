The conflict is caused by:
    baselines 0.1.5 depends on tensorflow>=1.4.0
    baselines 0.1.4 depends on tensorflow>=1.0.0
    baselines 0.1.3 depends on tensorflow>=1.0.0
    baselines 0.1.2 depends on tensorflow>=1.0.0
    baselines 0.1.1 depends on tensorflow>=1.0.0
    baselines 0.1.0 depends on tensorflow>=1.0.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
